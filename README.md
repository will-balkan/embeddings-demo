# Embeddings Demo
This is a barebones demo displaying the power of embeddings models for semantic search.

This project accesses a pinecone vector database containing Wikipedia information for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Entering text into the search bar and pressing enter will return the most similar text by generating embeddings for the text that was entered, and using these embeddings to query the vector database.

This demo was used as an example for a presenation on the uses of different AI APIs in web development.
